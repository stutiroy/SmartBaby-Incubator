# SmartBaby-Incubator
The proposed baby incubator's major goal is to provide the baby with the same environmental factors as in its mother's womb.
Depending on the baby's age, the temperature is kept at a few degrees Fahrenheit. 
When the temperature within the incubator falls below the appropriate temperature, a heater is used to boost the temperature, which is signaled by an LED.
When the baby's body temperature rises, the temperature inside the incubator rises as well, which is continuously sensed.
The fan is put on to lower the temperature inside the incubator when a certain predetermined value is reached.
The pulse rate, the sound of the infant, and the humidity level in the incubator are all monitored. 
In case of any unfortunate incident, the alarm and buzzer will alert the medical staff. 
Also, the report will be sent to the concerned person via Telegram.
